This could be handy in either of the following scenarios: Respecting character limit of text messages or tweets, determining the lenght of a password or many more. GitHub Parameters \uf0c1 Paramter | Type | Mandatory ------------ | ------------- | ------------ -Text | String | True Code \uf0c1 function Get-Chars { param ( [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$Text ) $Measureswitch = $Text | Measure-Object -Character $CharCount = $Measureswitch.Characters Write-Host \"Your switch contains $CharCount characters including spaces!\" } Get-Chars Usage \uf0c1 In order to call this function just run the script with PowerShell. \"Text\" is a mandatory parameter and can either be specified while calling the function directly or afterwards. Calling the function with the parameter -Text: Get-Chars -Text \"measure me this!\" Calling the function wihtout the parameter: Get-Chars Supply values for the following parameters: Text: measure me this! Output \uf0c1 The function will then count the amount of characters in your sting, including spaces and tell the length of it. Your string contains 16 characters including spaces. Note If you call the function including the <-Text> parameter you need to put your sting in quotes. If you choose to call the function without the parameter, you should not use quotes because they will be counted towards the result too.
